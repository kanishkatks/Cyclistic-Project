# Cyclistic-Project

Cyclstic Case Study - Google Data Analytics Certificate.
Using  R and Tableau.
This is originally based on the case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman.

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, we want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diŦerently. From these insights, we will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

In this case study, I analysed the key the differences between riders with membership subscriptions and casual riders with day passes. In this project, I identified the business question, obtained the data, cleaned the data for analysis , performed exploratory data analysis and futher analyzed the data and performed statistics. Subsquently, I made summary to share key findings with visualizations(created in Tableau). Consquently, I provided recommendations to implement to convert casual rider to members.
